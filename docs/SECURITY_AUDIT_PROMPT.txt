SECURITY AUDIT REQUEST

Please conduct a comprehensive security audit of all project dependencies following the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Dependency Security Audits.

Execute all phases:

Phase 1: Intelligence Gathering & Reconnaissance
- Research recent security vulnerabilities for our tech stack (React, Next.js, npm ecosystem)
- Identify high-impact CVEs from the last 30-60 days
- Check for known malicious packages and supply chain attacks

Phase 2: Automated Vulnerability Scanning
- Run pnpm audit on backend (251 dependencies)
- Run pnpm audit on frontend (449 dependencies)
- Generate JSON reports for analysis

Phase 3: Manual Verification & Analysis
- Verify critical framework versions (Next.js, React, React-DOM)
- Analyze audit reports for real-world impact
- Check for known malicious packages in our dependency tree

Phase 4: Remediation & Patching
- Apply automated fixes with pnpm audit --fix
- Manually update packages if needed
- Use pnpm.overrides for sub-dependency vulnerabilities
- Verify all fixes and confirm zero vulnerabilities

Phase 5: Reporting & Documentation
- Create comprehensive security audit report
- Commit all changes to GitHub
- Deliver report with findings and actions taken

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Backend: Node.js/Express with 251 dependencies
- Frontend: Next.js 14 + React 18 with 449 dependencies
- Repository: https://github.com/TZEK89/affiliate-marketing-system

Please be thorough, research actively, and ensure our code is secure. Thank you!
